This is Notification page that I made with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.
Use bootstrap grid system for making this page responsive.
Also use media queries to make this more responsive.
Write basic JavaScript.

Functions: 
i) when you click on "mark all as read" button so all the notification will be mark as read.
ii) You can also click individually on notification to mark as read.
